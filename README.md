Oh my god, just walked out of Ask Sadece Bir An and my brain is like scrambled eggs. The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing, like sitting inside a big icy popcorn box, and speaking of—popcorn EVERYWHERE. It’s like the  ’s still stuck in my head, every scene bleeding into the next. They had this moment, you know, where the character just stood in the rain, without an umbrella, like my mind feels right now, with rain and emotions pouring down all at once.

The sound in there was way too loud, jeez my ears are ringing like an old telephone (remember those?), but that didn’t stop the sheer beauty of that sunset scene, ugh how do I even describe it? It was like if you took melted crayons and let them spill over the screen. Or maybe like the glow of a lava lamp but a million times grander?

> There was a dog. Or was it a cat? My memory’s a mess, but anyway, its eyes seemed to peer through the screen, almost whispering secrets, reminding me of that time we tried to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   because John wanted it so badly. Right, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you haven’t already—it’s this whirlpool of sensations twisting you in a billion different directions!

I barely noticed my aching back because I couldn’t look away, oh boy, when the main character said something like “Life waits for no one,” I felt that in my soul. But ugh, I made the mistake of forgetting my jacket and now I’m feeling it—lesson learned: emotional rollercoasters need warmth, like hot chocolate on a winter’s day.

Trying to remember what someone said about the pacing, oh well, my thoughts are jelly right now. There was laughter, tears, and that one weird random moment with the oddly shaped cloud—like a sheep? Talk about moody sheep skies, ha. Couldn’t help but giggle, even if nobody else did, just me and my giggly popcorn mess.
